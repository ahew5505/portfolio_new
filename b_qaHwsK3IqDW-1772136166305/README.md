# Portfolio Website

This is a Next.js 13 application built with the App Router. It's intended to be deployed to Vercel and includes basic SEO enhancements and automatic sitemap/robots support.

## Deployment Notes

1. **Base URL**
   - Set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` environment variable on Vercel to the canonical URL of your site (e.g. `https://andyhewitt.com`).
   - This value is used by the metadata open graph tags and the dynamically generated `sitemap.xml`.

2. **Sitemap & Robots**
   - The `/sitemap.xml` endpoint is generated by a server route (`app/sitemap.xml.ts`). It lists the primary sections of the portfolio.
   - A static `public/robots.txt` file points search engines to the sitemap.
   - Update the domain inside `public/robots.txt` if you aren't using the environment variable for robots.

3. **Metadata**
   - Global metadata in `app/layout.tsx` now includes Open Graph, Twitter card info, and canonical/robots directives.
   - Make sure your Open Graph image (`/og.png`) exists or replace with your own asset.

4. **Vercel Configuration**
    - Because the code lives in a subdirectory (`b_qaHwsK3IqDW-1772136166305`) of the repository, configure the **Root Directory** in the Vercel project settings to that folder (`b_qaHwsK3IqDW-1772136166305`).
    - Do **not** include `rootDirectory` in `vercel.json` (the platform rejects that property). If you previously added `vercel.json` with `rootDirectory`, remove that property and instead set the root in the Vercel UI.
    - You can add custom headers or routing preferences in `vercel.json` if needed (but avoid unsupported top‑level properties).
    - The default build command (`npm run build`) and output (`next start`) are already specified in `package.json`.
    - Push the repository to GitHub and connect the project in Vercel; it will detect the framework automatically.

5. **Other Best Practices**
   - Avoid `ignoreBuildErrors` in production by fixing TypeScript issues; it's enabled currently for convenience.
   - Keep dependencies up to date and add any analytics or meta you require.

Once deployed, your site will be crawlable by search engines and compliant with standard Vercel deployment conventions.
